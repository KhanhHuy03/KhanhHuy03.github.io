#### Introduction

In the context of rapid digital transformation, the use of cloud computing services like AWS is becoming increasingly popular to optimize IT infrastructure and improve operational efficiency. However, along with the flexibility and scalability of the cloud comes the challenge of controlling and optimizing costs. The topic "FinOps Implementation with Automated Cost Governance on AWS" focuses on applying modern financial management methods (FinOps) combined with AWS automation tools to help organizations proactively monitor, detect anomalies, and optimize spending on the cloud platform. This enables organizations to ensure efficient resource usage, save budgets, and support sustainable development goals.

#### Solution Architecture and Services Used

The FinOps solution with Automated Cost Governance on AWS is built on an architecture that integrates multiple AWS services to automate monitoring, analysis, and cost optimization. The main components of this architecture include:

- **AWS Budgets**: Set budgets, monitor spending, and send alerts when thresholds are exceeded.
- **AWS Cost Anomaly Detection**: Automatically detect cost anomalies and provide timely alerts.
- **AWS Cost & Usage Report (CUR)**: Collect and analyze detailed usage and cost data.
- **AWS Compute Optimizer**: Provide recommendations to optimize compute resources such as EC2, EBS, and Lambda.
- **AWS Lambda**: Automatically check and handle unused or underutilized resources.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitor, collect logs, and visualize cost and performance data.
- **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)**: Send automated notifications to email, Slack, or other communication channels.
- **Amazon S3**: Store reports, logs, and cost analysis data.

These services work together to form an automated cost management system, enabling organizations to proactively control, quickly detect issues, and optimize AWS spending effectively and
