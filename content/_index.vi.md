#### Overview

In this first lab, you will create a new **AWS account** and set up **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** to enhance account security. Next, you will create an **Admin Group** and **Admin User** to manage resource access instead of using the root account.  
Finally, you will be guided on how to verify your account with **AWS Support** in case you encounter login or authentication issues.

#### FinOps Implementation with Automated Cost Governance on AWS

FinOps is a methodology that combines finance and operations to proactively and transparently optimize cloud costs. On AWS, implementing FinOps with automated tools helps organizations control, forecast, and optimize spending more effectively. By integrating solutions such as AWS Budgets, Cost Anomaly Detection, Cost & Usage Report, Compute Optimizer, and automating idle resource checks, organizations can quickly detect cost anomalies, take timely actions, and continuously improve cost governance policies. This not only saves budget but also enhances AWS resource efficiency, ensuring alignment with business goals and sustainable development on the cloud platform.
